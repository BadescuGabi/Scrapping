# Scrapping
I wrote two basics scrapping aplications. The first one was written in Python for downloading photos from Google and creating a dynamic directory where they are stored.
The second one was written in C# and it's used for sending messages from laptop to any phone (this is possible by mighty text app which allows me to send sms from my phone 
number with no additional cost). Unfortunately, the application is a little unstable because sometimes chromedriver doesn't let me connect to my Google account.
